# quick-prox

## Goal 
A simple utility for quickly and easily logging network requests from 
command line tools. In particular, this should serve as a simpler alternative
to running burp or other similar proxies just to get requests logs
from a CLI application.

#### Use Cases
* Debugging scripts that make network requests
* Investigating what network requests are made by binaries/scripts
